To compile inline assembly using Intel to use with gdb do the following:
[davis@lect1 private]$ gcc -S -masm=intel selsorting2.c                          
[davis@lect1 private]$ as --gstabs -o selsorting2.o selsorting2.s
[davis@lect1 private]$ gcc -g -o selsorting.out selsorting2.o

Note that gcc automatically adds the following to the call:

push ebp
mov ebp, esp

So do not have them in your assembly.  I have commented them out in my
selsorting2.c
